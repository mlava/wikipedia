This simple extension takes your Roam Research page name as a search query for Wikipedia, and returns the extract, featured image and a link to the Wikipedia page.

You can configure the number of sentences from the extract to obtain in the Roam Depot configuration settings, but default is 6. No other configuarion is required.

Trigger this either by:

- Command Palette using the command 'Wikipedia import'
- Using SmartBlocks using the <%WIKIPEDIA%>

Example output:

Alternatively, you can import the Featured Article of the Day or On This Day content.

Both of these options can be triggered via the Command Palette or via SmartBlocks.

- Wikipedia On This Day or <%ONTHISDAY%>
- Wikipedia Featured Content or <%WIKIFEATURED%>
